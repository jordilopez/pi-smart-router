# pi Smart Router

A [Pi coding-agent](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-coding-agent) extension that registers a custom provider, `pi-smart-router`, with a single model `pi-smart-router/auto`. Each prompt is classified locally (no extra LLM calls) and routed through a **four-tier** resolver to the best configured **backend model** through Pi's model registry.

The router's classification model and its execution model are separate concerns: the router currently uses deterministic local heuristics to choose a backend, while the selected backend LLM performs the actual work. In particular, the `fast` backend is **not** used as a judge or a pre-routing classifier. An optional fast-LLM classifier is discussed as a future enhancement in [Adaptive routing and future upgrades](#adaptive-routing-and-future-upgrades).

```
pi -e ./src/index.ts
# then: /model pi-smart-router/auto
```

> **Note:** The default configuration, examples, and testing have only used the `opencode-go` provider. Other providers *may* work but are untested; the session header injection (`x-opencode-session`) is currently `opencode-go`-specific.

## The four tiers (recommended policy)

All routes use pi's built-in `opencode-go` provider (auth: `OPENCODE_API_KEY`, `pi auth opencode-go`, or `/login opencode-go`). Pi's footer keeps showing `pi-smart-router/auto`; the `[pi-smart-router]` route log line identifies the actual backend used for each turn.

| Tier | Route | Backend | Intent |
|---|---|---|---|
| cheap | `cheap-code` | `opencode-go/mimo-v2.5` | Trivial work: greetings, quick questions, mechanical low-risk tasks (renames, formatting, imports, boilerplate, simple CRUD, test scaffolds). Score-driven via `cheapMax` (0.18) plus explicit mechanical-task rules. **Not local** - mimo-v2.5 is a cheap hosted code model. |
| fast | `fast` | `opencode-go/glm-5.3-flash` | Greetings, quick questions, trivial lookups. |
| balanced | `balanced` | `opencode-go/gpt-5.6-luna` (exact lowercase ID) | The everyday default: normal coding, reviews, multi-file edits. |
| powerful | `powerful` | `opencode-go/kimi-k3` | Genuinely difficult work only: architecture/system design, root-cause debugging, race conditions/concurrency, security vulnerabilities, hard performance bottlenecks, formal proofs/algorithmic reasoning, cross-cutting refactors. |

**Kimi is dramatically more expensive** (an order of magnitude above the other tiers) and is deliberately hard to reach:

- The default `mediumMax` threshold is **0.80**, so only the highest complexity scores reach the powerful tier without explicit rules.
- Explicit powerful rules use **high-confidence phrases only** (e.g. "root cause", "race condition", "system design", "security vulnerability", "performance bottleneck", "formal proof") - never generic words like `analyze`, `debug`, `design`, or `implement`.
- `powerful` is **never** in `fallbacks`; the default fallback chain is `fast` → `cheap-code`.
- Ordinary code-looking prompts are **not** dumped onto cheap-code; they flow through the score tiers to balanced. The only cheap-code rule is scoped to explicit mechanical-task phrases.

## How it works

1. `streamSimple` is called by Pi for `pi-smart-router/auto`.
2. Once per **turn**, the prompt/context is classified locally into features and a weighted **complexity score** (0-1) is computed. The classifier estimates prompt and context tokens, detects code and reasoning signals, counts keyword-group matches, and records whether tools or images are present. It does not call any LLM, inspect the quality of a previous answer, or predict success semantically.
3. A deterministic resolver picks a **route** (see [Routing decision order](#routing-decision-order)). Each route maps to a backend `provider/modelId`. The score is compared with configurable thresholds; explicit high-confidence rules can override those thresholds.
4. The request is delegated to the backend provider via `modelRegistry.getProvider(...).streamSimple(...)`, with auth (`apiKey`/`headers`/`baseUrl`) resolved through `modelRegistry.getApiKeyAndHeaders(...)`. All stream events are forwarded unchanged.
5. Tool-call continuations **reuse the turn's route decision** - the backend never changes mid-turn.

### Declared context window of `pi-smart-router/auto`

`pi-smart-router/auto` is a **virtual model** - it is never contacted and has no real context window of its own. Its registered `contextWindow` (1M, mirroring the configured 1M-context backends) exists only for Pi core's view of the router: the UI display and compaction triggering. A smaller declared value would make Pi compact conversations long before the backends were actually full.

Actual per-turn fit is enforced separately and per backend: the resolver checks estimated context tokens against each backend model's own `contextWindow * 0.8` (see [Compatibility checks](#routing-decision-order)). If you add backends with smaller windows than 1M, routing stays correct, but the declared 1M makes compaction timing optimistic.

### How the local complexity score is formed

The classifier is intentionally lightweight and deterministic. It extracts signals from the latest user prompt and the current context, normalizes them to 0–1, then combines them with configurable weights:

- **Prompt size** - an estimated token count using `characters / 4`, normalized against `maxPromptTokens`.
- **Context size** - an estimated count including the system prompt, messages, tool-call arguments, and images. This has a deliberately low default weight so a long-running session does not automatically become a powerful-tier request.
- **Code likelihood** - code-related words and patterns such as fenced code, declarations, file paths, stack traces, and code punctuation.
- **Reasoning likelihood** - reasoning and evaluation language such as “compare”, “why”, “trade-off”, “root cause”, “design”, and “review”.
- **Keyword signal** - matches across reasoning, architecture, debugging, performance, and security keyword groups.
- **Tool signal** - only tools beyond a typical bare Pi coding session baseline (about eight tools) raise this signal. The standard tool set is session state, not prompt difficulty, and does not consume the cheap-tier score budget.
- **Image signal** - whether images are present. This is normally weighted at zero because image support is enforced separately by backend capability checks.

The weighted result is clamped to 0–1 and compared with `cheapMax`, `simpleMax`, and `mediumMax`. With the defaults, scores up to `0.18` target cheap-code, scores through `0.35` target fast, scores up to `0.80` target balanced, and higher scores target powerful. Cheap-code is additionally reachable at any score through explicit mechanical-task rules. These are approximate signals, not a model's semantic assessment of whether it can solve the task.

## Install

### Try it for one session

Run the extension directly without installing it:

```sh
pi -e /path/to/pi-smart-router/src/index.ts
```

### Install globally for your user

Install the package into Pi's global settings (the default; do not use `-l`):

```sh
pi install /path/to/pi-smart-router
```

For this repository:

```sh
pi install /Users/jordi/development/routerrific/pi-smart-router
```

Verify the installation:

```sh
pi list
pi --list-models | grep pi-smart-router
```

After installation, start Pi normally. You no longer need `-e`:

```sh
pi
```

If your `~/.pi/agent/settings.json` contains an `enabledModels` allowlist, add the router explicitly or it will be hidden from the model selector:

```json
{
  "enabledModels": [
    "pi-smart-router/auto",
    "opencode-go/glm-5.3-flash",
    "opencode-go/mimo-v2.5",
    "opencode-go/gpt-5.6-luna",
    "opencode-go/kimi-k3"
  ]
}
```

Use `pi install -l /path/to/pi-smart-router` only for a project-local installation. Global installs are recorded in `~/.pi/agent/settings.json`; project-local installs are recorded in `.pi/settings.json`.

The extension loads as plain TypeScript (Pi loads extensions via jiti) - no build step. `zod` is a runtime dependency; TypeScript and Vitest are only needed for development.

## Configuration files

Two-file layout:

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `~/.pi/agent/models.json` or `<project>/.pi/models.json` | Standard Pi backend providers/models (untouched; the `opencode-go` catalog is built into pi) |
| `~/.pi/agent/pi-smart-router.json` | Global routing config |
| `<project>/.pi/pi-smart-router.json` | Project routing config (**only loaded when the project is trusted**) |

**Precedence:** project config (if trusted and present) > global config > built-in defaults. A config file that exists replaces the lower-priority one entirely (no deep merge).

Built-in defaults (used when no config file exists) mirror the recommended policy: `fast` → `opencode-go/glm-5.3-flash`, `cheap-code` → `opencode-go/mimo-v2.5`, `balanced` → `opencode-go/gpt-5.6-luna`, `powerful` → `opencode-go/kimi-k3`; defaultRoute `balanced`; fallbacks `["fast", "cheap-code"]`.

Routes are only resolved when actually selected - backends that don't exist or aren't configured do **not** break the extension; they're skipped and the fallback chain takes over. But **invalid config files fail loudly on load** (see [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)).

    "logDecisions": false             // emit the detailed decision log (adds rule, reason, explanation)
  }
}
```

User keywords in rules are matched as **escaped literal phrases** (case-insensitive, whitespace-flexible); no arbitrary regex from config is evaluated.

## Routing decision order

For each new turn (re-classified only on `turn_start`):

1. **Explicit rules**, highest `priority` first. A matching rule is used only if its route resolves to an available + compatible backend; otherwise evaluation continues.
2. **Complexity thresholds** (cheap → fast → balanced → powerful): score ≤ `cheapMax` (default `0.18`) → route named `cheap`/`cheap-code`/`low-cost`/`economy`; ≤ `simpleMax` (default `0.35`) → `fast`/`simple`/...; ≤ `mediumMax` → `balanced`/...; above `mediumMax` → `powerful`/.... Alias matching is exact-name first, then name-segment match (e.g. `my-cheap-code-route` matches the cheap tier, but `fastest` does not match `fast`). If the tier route doesn't exist or is unavailable, fall through to `defaultRoute`. If **LLM escalation** is enabled and the score falls inside the escalation band, the classifier's verdict replaces this tier (see below).
3. **`defaultRoute`**.
4. **`fallbacks`**, in order.
5. **Any available route** (declaration order).
6. If nothing is available: stream error `NO_FALLBACK_AVAILABLE`.

**Compatibility checks** before a route is accepted:

- images in context require the backend model to list `"image"` in `input` (all four opencode-go models support images)
- estimated context tokens must fit `contextWindow * 0.8` (opencode-go models offer ~1M context, so this rarely binds)
- explicit `reasoning` (`low|medium|high`) requires `model.reasoning`
- route `maxTokens` must not exceed `model.maxTokens`
- the model/provider must exist and have configured auth

## LLM escalation (borderline band)

The heuristic classifier is fast, free, and blind to meaning — prompts near a
tier boundary can land on the wrong side (e.g. a short review request scoring
just under `simpleMax`). Escalation refines exactly those borderline turns:

- **When:** `escalation.enabled` is true, no images are present, no explicit
  rule resolved the turn, and the complexity score is inside
  `[minScore, maxScore]` (defaults 0.12–0.35).
- **What happens:** one tiny call (`maxTokens: 4`, `temperature: 0`) to the
  classifier model — `escalation.model` if set, otherwise the **fast tier's**
  route — asking it to answer `fast` or `balanced` for the latest request,
  given a bounded recent transcript (≤ ~2000 tokens) plus the heuristic's own
  signals. The verdict replaces the heuristic tier (it may promote *or*
  demote); anything else — timeout (`timeoutMs`, default 1500), stream error,
  or an unparseable answer — keeps the heuristic tier.
- **Never:** the classifier can never select `powerful` or `cheap`, cannot
  point at the router itself (`pi-smart-router/*` is rejected at config load),
  and never overrides explicit rules, `defaultRoute`, or fallbacks.
- **Cost:** one classifier call at most once per turn (the per-turn route
  cache applies), only for in-band prompts.

```jsonc
{
  "escalation": {
    "enabled": true,
    "minScore": 0.12,
    "maxScore": 0.35,
    "model": "opencode-go/glm-5.3-flash", // optional: defaults to the fast tier route
    "timeoutMs": 1500
  }
}
```

The route log line includes `esc=<heuristic-tier>-><verdict>` for escalated
turns (or `esc=-`); the footer status shows `router: escalating…` while the
classifier call is in flight.

## Turn stability

- The route decision is cached per turn. Within a turn (e.g. tool-call continuations) the **same backend is reused**; only classification/route resolution is skipped - every stream request still delegates to the backend.
- `turn_start` resets the cache. A message-based heuristic (new user prompt after tool results) is kept as fallback safety.
- The backend is never switched after the first stream event; failures after content has been emitted surface as stream errors, not fallbacks.

## Adaptive routing and future upgrades

The router has one limited, opt-in adaptive feature: **borderline-band LLM escalation**. When enabled, a fast classifier can replace a heuristic `fast`/`balanced` decision for prompts in the configured score band. It does not retry failed work or observe answer quality. The broader router still has no success/failure feedback loop:

- A backend that is unavailable or incompatible is skipped **before streaming** and the normal fallback order is used.
- Once streaming begins, the selected backend is fixed for the turn. Backend errors are surfaced as stream errors; they are not retried on another route.
- If a user sends a follow-up, that is a new turn and is classified from the new context. A follow-up such as “find the root cause” may naturally score higher, but that is not escalation memory.
- A successful response is not validated by the router. It cannot tell whether a code change is correct unless the user or a later tool result makes that visible in a new request.

Possible future upgrades, deliberately not enabled by the current implementation:

1. **Retry with escalation** - after a pre-output backend failure, retry on the next stronger route (`fast` → `balanced` → `powerful`). This needs safeguards for partial output, duplicate tool calls, cancellation, retry limits, and additional cost. Retrying after partial output is especially risky because the user may already have seen an incomplete answer.
2. **Cross-turn escalation memory** - remember repeated backend errors, failed tests, or unsuccessful attempts and raise a session's minimum tier for subsequent turns. This would need explicit reset/decay rules so one transient failure does not make every later prompt expensive.
3. **Signal-based escalation** - promote when a turn reaches a configurable number of tool calls, repeated tool errors, a context-compaction event, or another observable difficulty signal. Tool-call continuations would need a clear policy for whether the current turn can switch models or only the next turn can.
4. **Optional fast-LLM pre-classification** - ask a small, fast model to estimate task difficulty or recommend a route before the main request runs. That could provide semantic judgment that local heuristics cannot, but it adds latency and cost, requires its own timeout/fallback behavior, and would send prompt/context data to an additional model. The classifier must also be prevented from recursively routing through `pi-smart-router/auto`.
5. **Model-aware routing** - have either local rules or an optional classifier evaluate “is this task suitable for model X?” rather than only assigning a generic complexity score. Capability checks would still remain authoritative for context windows, images, reasoning, and output limits.

Until one of these policies is implemented, users should treat the route status as the backend selected **before** the turn starts, not as a live assessment of how well the task is progressing.

## Route visibility in Pi's UI

- **Footer status** - after each route decision the footer shows the active backend, e.g. `↳ balanced · opencode-go/gpt-5.6-luna (0.42)`. On a new turn it briefly shows `router: classifying…` until the decision replaces it, and it is cleared when the session shuts down. This is enabled by default and does not depend on `logDecisions`.
- **No transcript noise** - route decisions are intentionally *not* appended to the transcript; the footer status is the single source of that information. For the full detail (reason, explanation, matched rule), check the log file below.
- **Footer model unchanged** - Pi's normal footer model remains `pi-smart-router/auto`; the footer status line above is where you see which backend actually served the turn.

## Observability (log file)

Diagnostics are written to a **log file, never to stdout/stderr** - raw console output from an in-process extension is painted directly over the pi TUI and corrupts the input line. One log line is emitted per route decision (never includes prompt text) and names the **actual backend**. With the default `showRouteStatus: true` the concise line is logged:

```
[2026-02-14T10:12:33.001Z] [pi-smart-router] route=balanced backend=opencode-go/gpt-5.6-luna score=0.42 turn=3 session=a1b2c3d4
```

Setting `logDecisions: true` switches to the detailed line, which adds the matched rule, decision reason, and explanation:

```
[2026-02-14T10:12:33.001Z] [pi-smart-router] route=balanced backend=opencode-go/gpt-5.6-luna score=0.42 turn=3 session=a1b2c3d4 rule=- reason=threshold detail="Complexity 0.42 (balanced tier) -> route 'balanced'"
```

The log file defaults to `<tmpdir>/pi-smart-router.log` (e.g. `/tmp/pi-smart-router.log` on macOS/Linux) and can be redirected with the `PI_SMART_ROUTER_LOG` environment variable (a leading `~` is expanded; `~user` forms are not):

```sh
PI_SMART_ROUTER_LOG=~/.pi/agent/logs/pi-smart-router.log pi
```

The `session=` prefix (first 8 characters of the Pi session id) disambiguates parallel pi sessions appending to a shared log file. Config-load diagnostics on `session_start` and config errors are also logged to the file; config errors additionally surface as a `ctx.ui.notify` toast in the TUI, and router-originated stream failures are prefixed with their error code (e.g. `BACKEND_AUTH_MISSING: ...`) in the stream error message. No raw prompt data is ever logged or stored in entries.

## Selecting the router

After a global installation:

```sh
pi
# in the TUI: /model pi-smart-router/auto
# or from the shell:
pi --model pi-smart-router/auto
```

When running directly from the repository, include the extension path:

```sh
pi -e ./src/index.ts --model pi-smart-router/auto
```

## Troubleshooting

- **`400 MissingSessionID: Request is missing x-opencode-session`** - Console Go (opencode-go) requires a session header to route requests efficiently. The router forwards Pi's **stable session id** (captured on `session_start` from `ctx.sessionManager.getSessionId()`) as the `x-opencode-session` header on every opencode-go request, so the value stays constant across prompts and tool continuations. If the caller already supplies its own `x-opencode-session` header or `options.sessionId`, that explicit value wins and is forwarded as-is. The header is only injected for `opencode-go` - other providers are untouched.
- **`No credentials configured for provider 'opencode-go'`** - auth missing. Run `pi auth opencode-go`, set `OPENCODE_API_KEY`, or use `/login opencode-go`.
- **`Model not found in registry: provider/modelId`** - the route references a model Pi doesn't know. Check spelling (model IDs are exact and lowercase, e.g. `gpt-5.6-luna`) and run `pi --list-models opencode-go` to see the catalog.
- **`No compatible backend model available for any configured route`** - every route failed the availability/compatibility checks (missing auth, model missing, context window too small for the current conversation, etc.).
- **Config error at startup** - pi-smart-router.json is invalid (bad JSON, unknown route reference, duplicate rule id, malformed `provider/modelId`, wrong `version`). Fix the file; the message names the offending path.
- **Kimi (powerful) shows up more than expected** - check your `mediumMax` (default 0.80) and your rules; the policy deliberately keeps kimi-k3 rare and out of the fallback chain.

## Limitations

- Routing is **per turn, not per tool call**: tool-call continuations keep the turn's route even if the intermediate prompt looks different.
- Token counts are **heuristics** (`chars/4`, images ≈ 512 tokens); treat thresholds as approximate.
- Classification is local heuristics (keywords/patterns) - no extra LLM call, and no semantic understanding. The `fast` route is an execution backend, not a classifier or judge.
- Routing does not currently evaluate answer quality, test outcomes, tool-loop length, or whether a task is “succeeding” after it starts.
- `reasoning: "off"` cannot force-disable thinking on providers that always think; it only avoids requesting reasoning. `preserve` keeps the session's thinking level.
- Backend availability is evaluated when the decision is made; a backend that dies mid-turn surfaces as a stream error (no mid-turn failover).
- Adaptive escalation, retry-with-a-stronger-model, and optional fast-LLM classification are future design options, not current behavior.

## Development

```sh
npm install
npx tsc --noEmit   # typecheck (resolves pi packages via tsconfig paths)
npx vitest run     # unit tests (classifier, route resolver, config, stream contract)
```

The typecheck/tests resolve `@earendil-works/pi-ai` / `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` from the installed Pi CLI (see `tsconfig.json` paths and `vitest.config.ts`); override with `PI_PACKAGE_DIR` if your Pi install lives elsewhere.
